# RISCOSS Risk Modeling

The [RISCOSS project](http://www.riscoss.eu) will offer novel risk identification, management and mitigation tools and methods for community-based and industry-supported OSS development. 

RISCOSS will deliver a decision-making management platform integrated in a business-oriented decision-making framework, which together support placing technical OSS adoption decisions into organizational, business strategy and broader OSS community context.

This repository cointains the models that can be used in the RISCOSS platform (configuring the risk configurations) in order to get the risk analysis (running risk sessions) associated to an entity.

In the RISCOSS platform we have 2 kinds of models (risk and goal models), these models are needed to describe the assessed risks and the impacted goals for a concrete entity. In order to perform the risk analysis for an specific entity, the risk models can use some data gathered by the data collectors configured for this entity.

Please see https://github.com/RISCOSS/riscoss-data-collector for detailed information about the data collectors.

Detailed information about RISCOSS models in [this repository wiki](https://github.com/RISCOSS/riscoss-risk-modeling/wiki)

#How to contribute to this repository
The models will be placed in the corresponding folder depending on the model kind (risk or goal model). And some documentation should be provided for each model.
